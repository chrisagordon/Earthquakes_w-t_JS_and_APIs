# Earthquakes with JavaScript and APIs

## 1. OVERVIEW
For this project, an end user was interested in gaining insight on the recency and location of Earthquakes across the globe in the last seven days. By using html, JavaScript, Bootstrap styling and JSON data from APIs by USGS we are able to create a map of Earthquakes within the last seven days.


## 2. RESULTS
Here is an image of the overall map.

The photo below shows the selection dropdown legend which can be used to adjust what is visible on the map.

We have three different background maps that can be selected based on the users desire: Streets, Satellelite or Dark. The original image shows the street view, the next two photos display half of the satellite and half of the dark maps.

Additionally the user may select whether or not they wish to see the tectonic plates, Earthquakes (meaning all available in the API) or Major Earthquakes (earthquakes with a magnitude of 4.5 or higher).
